# akuku

Small timing counter utility.
Uses `process.hrtime` to collect all time intervals between `start` and `stop`.

## Install

```sh
$ npm install --save akuku
```

## Usage

```js
let tm = require('akuku')('module name'); // kind of like debug

let countSomething = tm.counter('something');

tm.start();
// do something

countSomething();

tm.stop();

next = tm.start(next);

doSomethingAsync(function() {

  countSomething(5); // you can optionally pass a bigger counter

  next();
});

// later

tm.dump(); // will print sum of times between start and stop, and all associated counters
```

## Environment

The `AKUKU` environment variable has to be set to `1`, `on`, or `true` to enable `akuku` timers and counters.

    AKUKU=1 node myapp

When `AKUKU` is not defined or set to a _falsy_ value `akuku` API is implemented using empty stubs.

## API

### `start(next = undefined, count = 1)`

Starts counting time - returns the `stop` function. If `next` is specified returns wrapped version of `next` that
stops timer before calling next.

### `stop()`

Stops counting time.

### `toString()`

Displays formatted internal state - something like:


### `toObject()`

Raw state:

- `active` - sum of all intervals between start and stop as [ seconds, nano ] pair
- `counter` - number of times start was called
- `activeNow` - true if between start and stop when called
- `counters` - additional counters as name => values object

### `counter(name)`

Creates additional named counter.
Returns counter function, which - whenever called - will increment internal counter named `name`
Its value will become part of the state.
